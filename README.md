## Project Overview

The **Remote Soil Resistance Monitoring and Alerting System** is an IoT-based solution designed to modernize soil resistance measurement ‚Äî a key factor in both agricultural efficiency and electrical grounding safety.

By integrating temperature and moisture sensors with an ATmega328P microcontroller and a GSM module, the system provides continuous monitoring and real-time alerts via SMS, eliminating the need for costly manual testing with instruments such as the Fluke 1625.

### Key Features
- Real-time monitoring of soil resistance  
- Automatic alerting via GSM (SMS)  
- Low-cost, portable, and energy-efficient design  
- Suitable for both **agricultural** and **electrical grounding** applications  

---

## Motivation and Relevance

### Electrical Safety
In power systems, **soil resistance directly affects grounding efficiency.**

- **High resistance ‚Üí Poor grounding ‚Üí Safety risk**  
- **Low resistance ‚Üí Good grounding ‚Üí Stable operation**

Applications:
- Industrial facilities  
- Solar PV arrays  
- Residential systems  
- Power transmission lines  

### Agricultural Applications
Soil resistance correlates with **moisture levels**, allowing optimized irrigation:

- **High resistance ‚Üí Dry soil ‚Üí Irrigation required**  
- **Low resistance ‚Üí Moist soil ‚Üí Irrigation not needed**

**Benefits**
- Up to **50% water savings**  
- **10‚Äì30% increase** in crop yield  
- Remote monitoring through GSM communication

### Data Flow

1. Sensors collect temperature and moisture data.
2. The microcontroller calculates soil resistance using an empirical model.
3. If the resistance exceeds a defined threshold, alerts are activated locally (buzzer) and remotely (SMS).

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Circuit Design and Simulation

* Circuit schematic created and simulated in **Proteus 8.6**.
* Integrated simulation libraries for Arduino, GSM, and Buzzer modules.
* Functionality verified virtually before physical assembly.

### Phase 2: Physical Implementation

* Sensors calibrated and connected to the **ATmega328P**.
* GSM module configured for SMS communication.
* Data displayed locally via LCD and remotely through text alerts.

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation

* Soil samples with varying moisture levels tested.
* Real-world performance compared to traditional soil resistance methods.

### ‚úÖ Notes
- Uses **clean academic markdown formatting** (flat badges, no emojis except neutral icons in contact).
- Uses **proper section hierarchy** so it looks like professional documentation.
- All diagrams and tables render correctly on GitHub.
- You can add your images (e.g., `images/circuit.png`, `images/simulation.png`) where relevant ‚Äî just insert `![description](path/to/image.png)` under the right sections.

Would you like me to make a **slightly shorter version** (for a cleaner first impression when someone opens your GitHub page)? It can summarize the highlights in 1‚Äì2 screens before they scroll down.
